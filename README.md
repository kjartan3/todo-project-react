# React Todo List App
This is a simple React app that allows you to create a todo list. You can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from the list. The app uses local storage to store the tasks, so they will persist even if you refresh the page.

## How to Use the App
The app is very simple to use. There are two main components: the input form for adding new tasks, and the list of tasks that have already been added.

## Adding a New Task
To add a new task, simply type the task into the input field and click the "Add" button. The new task will be added to the bottom of the list.

## Completing a Task
To mark a task as completed, click on the checkbox next to the task. The task will be crossed out to indicate that it has been completed.

## Deleting a Task
To delete a task, click on the "X" button next to the task. The task will be removed from the list.
